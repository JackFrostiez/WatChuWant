# WatChuWant  
Utilizing the Wegmans API, the application provides different recipes based on your input of " What Chu Want" to eat and how much time you have to prepare it, cook it, and enjoy it.

# Inspiration  
Inspiration came from our ambition to complete a well-developed project for the prize of using the Wegmans API.

# What it does  
The application first asks for what you currently feel like eating, then asks for the amount of time, in minutes, you have to prep, cook, and eat it, then finally generates a list of different recipes that you can check out on the Wegmans website to enjoy it!

# How I built it  
We built it on a Django framework utilizing different Python code to make the requests out to the API. This was all put together with HTML and CSS, with a hint of Javascript, to create the final product.

# Challenges I ran into  
The API was not working correctly for a short amount of time so it was first frustrating to run into issues that we didn't understand but then relieving after speaking to the engineers about the issue and having that get resolved as soon as possible. Ultimately, the API was a challenge of itself due to our lack of experience but we pulled through and got it together. In addition to that, the front-end design was a challenge too.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of  
Correctly getting the values from the JSON output of the API to implement the different stages of the application. Any sort of progress is an accomplishment of its own, big or small.

# What I learned  
Further debugging skills in the Developer Console on Google Chrome, further techniques on Django that worked well with the project. and Web and API scraping

# What's next for WhatChuWant  
Enhancements if possible to ensure it meets all the standards necessary and have further opportunities to impress others on the project

# Built With  
html, css, javascript, python, and django
